## 🐭 Scripts for statistical analysis of mouse behavioural tests 

>
>Download scripts and data files.

>
>After extracting the Data folder change the working directory in each .rmd file to the correct one for you.

>
>Run .rmd analysis files within each folder, clean RStudio workspace inbetween scripts.

## Contents

* **Elevated plus maze (EPM) folder** - contains scripts for statistical analysis and plotting (.rmd) for two mouse models, as well as raw data files (.csv) (4 files in total)

* **Marble burying folder** - contains 4 files for analysis and plotting (.rmd) and 4 files of raw data (.csv) for each model at each time point (8 files in total)

* **Optokinetic drum (OKD) folder** - contains scripts for statistical analysis and plotting for two mouse models (.rmd), as well as raw data files (.csv) (4 files in total)

* **Olfaction test folder** - contains 4 files for analysis and plotting (.rmd) and 4 files of raw data (.csv) for each model at each time point (8 files in total)

* **Social test folder** - contains scripts for statistical analysis and plotting (.rmd) for two mouse models, as well as raw data files, and data for the genotypes of each mouse (.csv) (6 files in total), during preprocessing two extra files are created per model

* **Weight and echo-MRI folder** - for each model there is a pre-processing file (.rmd), raw data file (.csv), file with data for the genotype and sex of each mouse (.csv), and file for statistical analysis (.rmd), run the pre-processing file first, once you have the final pre-processed file, ending on "_n3", run the file for statistical analysis.
For echo-MRI there is one file with raw data (.csv), and one file for statistical analysis (.rmd) (10 files in total)

* **Y-maze folder** - contains scripts for statistical analysis and plotting (.rmd) for two mouse models, as well as raw data files, and data for the genotypes of each mouse (.csv) (6 files in total), during preprocessing two extra files are created per model
